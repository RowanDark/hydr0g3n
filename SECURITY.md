any suggested mitigations. We will acknowledge receipt within five business days
and aim to provide status updates at least every two weeks until the issue is
resolved.

## Scope

All first-party code, documentation, and release artifacts produced in this repository
are in scope for security reports. Third-party dependencies should be reported to
their respective maintainers; however, please notify us if a dependency issue
impacts Hydr0g3n so that we can coordinate remediation.

## Coordinated Disclosure

We kindly request that you allow us adequate time to investigate and address the
issue before publicly disclosing it. We strive to publish security advisories and
patches promptly once a fix is available. When appropriate, we will credit
researchers who report vulnerabilities in accordance with this policy.
